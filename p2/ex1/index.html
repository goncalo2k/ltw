                <h2>Description</h2>
                Francesinha is a sandwich from northern Portugal, especially the Porto region. It has two slices of bread and various meats, covered with melted cheese and served with sauce and fries. The sauce is a unique part of the sandwich, with each restaurant having its own recipe made from tomatoes, broth, piri piri spices, beer and Port wine.
